Version 4.0  [2011-10-22]

  This version brings several incompatible changes with a common
  goal: instead of generating a full named.conf, produce a fragment
  which can be included from a parent config file.

  o  BIND_OPTIONS, FORWARD and SLAVE are gone. Just write the
     options to the parent config file. (If you think it is somewhat
     inconvenient, ask BIND developers to change the config file
     parser, so that multiple options { } sections can be specified.)
  o  Root hints became optional. If you want them, use ROOTHINT().

  Furthermore, several features have been added:

  o  A FORWARDING macro for generating forward-only zones.
  o  A BLACKHOLE macro for blackhole zones as per RFC 6303.
     Blackhole zones in example cf/domains updated to use this macro.
  o  When contents of a zone do not change, the version number is
     not incremented. Unfortunately, BIND tends to produce a warning
     in such cases, and it be turned off.

Version 3.1  [2008-05-21]

  o  Fixes for compatibility problems with recent versions of GNU m4.
  o  Added support for TXT, RP and SRV records.

Version 3.0.1  [2006-11-22]

  Fixed bugs in in the FORWARD and SLAVE macros, causing it to
  generate bogus output sometimes.

Version 3.0  [2005-02-20]

  One year of testing should be good enough, so releasing 2.99b as 3.0
  with almost no changes. The only one is:

  o  ZONE_OPTIONS macro added, allowing to add custom options to zones.

Version 2.99b  [2003-12-21]

  This version has been almost rewritten from scratch. The syntax
  of configuration files is incompatible with the previous versions,
  please read the README again.

  Most important changes:

  o  Support for IPv6.
  o  Much better configuration of classless reverse delegations.
  o  Better documentation and well-commented example files.
  o  The "chkdom" script is gone, use the DNS Sleuth instead.
  o  Cleaned up names of all macros, the namespaces are now clearly
     defined.

Version 2.3  [2001-06-27]

  o  Global parameters (hostmaster mail address etc.) can be set
     in cf/config now.
  o  Autodetect which M4 should be used.
  o  Fixed bugs in convert script.
  o  Generate $TTL to make new releases of bind happy.

Version 2.2  [1999-09-11]

  o  Corrected localhost records.
  o  Name-server restart command can be overriden (useful for setups
     with multiple named's).
  o  Added `convert' script for easy conversion of zone files to NSC
     domain files.
  o  Serial numbers are now Y2K clean.
  o  Added `chkdel' script for checking of zone delegations.
